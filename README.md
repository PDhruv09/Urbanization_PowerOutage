# Does Urbanization effect Power Outage ?
**By:- Dhruv Patel**

Project for Dsc 80 at UCSD

## Introduction
In this project, I examined a data set of major power outages in the U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. These major outages are defined by the Department of Energy to have impacted at least 50,000 customers, or causing an unplanned energy demand loss of at least 300 MegaWatts.This dataset was accessed from Purdue Universityâ€™s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure, at https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages.

The dataset includes information about the major outages, as well as geographical, climatic, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterns and economic characteristics of the states affected by the outages.

First, I will clean the data set and conduct exploratory data analysis in order to gain a basic understanding of the information provided. I will then analyze the missingness mechanisms and dependency of the data set.

Finally, I will explore my research question, How does the urbanization level of a state influence the number and duration of power outages? I will try to build a model that predicts coreraltion between the state's urbanization level and the number and duration of power outage.

The original raw DataFrame contains 1534 rows, corresponding to 1534 outages, and 57 columns. However, I will only focus on a few of these columns for the sake of my analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
The first step is to clean the data to make sure it is suitable for effective analysis.

### Cleaning
1. I start by seting the index to OBS and also dropping irrelevant columns and only keeping the features that I am interested in for analysis. These are:'U.S._STATE', 'YEAR', 'MONTH', 'OUTAGE.START', 'OUTAGE.RESTORATION', 'OUTAGE.DURATION', 'PCT_LAND', 'PCT_WATER_TOT', 'PCT_WATER_INLAND','POPPCT_URBAN', 'POPDEN_URBAN', 'POPDEN_UC', 'POPDEN_RURAL', 'RES.CUSTOMERS', 'COM.CUSTOMERS', 'IND.CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL.CUSTOMERS'.

2. Next, I combine the OUTAGE.START.DATE and OUTAGE.START.TIME columns into one Timestamp object in an OUTAGE.START column. I do the same for OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE and OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME. I then dropped the old columns since all the relevant information is in OUTAGE.START and OUTAGE.RESTORATON.

3. Next, I check my outcomes of OUTAGE.DURATION, MONTH, POPPCT_URBAN, POPDEN_URBAN for values of  NaN, which are likely indicative of missing values. Since major outages wouldn't have a duration of NaN minutes, or the urban poppulation percentage/urban population dencity bing NaN.

The first few rows of this cleaned DataFrame are shown below, with a portion of columns selected.
